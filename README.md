## Hi there 👋

I do write smart contracts. I started to do that because when I looked at web3 I see equality for everyone and future of economy therefore I want it to be part of it. I used Solidity and Javascript so far. I have a good understanding on Solidity and Javascript.

## Journey
Started at 2023 may as a trader and ever since I'm child I always like to look into things deeper and have control over it and after that I started into coding smart contracts. Before I was coding java script a little game development but this was most exicted for me. At August 2023 I started coding with remix looking for projects and to build and learn did nft market place, erc20, staking, voting-governance for a start. Then I want to get a job and realized I need bigger projects therefore I did a BlackJack and erc721-erc20 exchange projects to get a job. Now I'm looking.

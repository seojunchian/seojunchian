## Hi there 👋

I'm Alp Yusuf Çilo from Turkey, and I do write smart contracts. I started to do that because when I looked at web3 I see equality for everyone and future of economy therefore I want it to be part of it. I used Solidity and Javascript so far. I have a good understanding on Solidity and Javascript.

## Skills and Experience
* 📝 Solidity
* 🌐 Javascript

* Other than helping people on reddit, discord and telegram there's no official experience.

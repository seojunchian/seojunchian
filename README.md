## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Alp from Turkey, and I do write smart contracts. I started to do that because when I looked at web3 I see equality for everyone and future of economy therefore I want it to be part of it. I used Solidity and Javascript so far. I have a good understanding on Solidity but not much on Javascript. You can checkout my twitter https://www.twitter.com/alpcwork
